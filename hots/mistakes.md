Attention
===

 + Wrong micro
  + Using overcharge v Z when he doesn't really pushes and/or when 
    I don't have enough sentries
  + Don't release zealot(s) too far from 1-square holes and/or 
    building surface when defending 6-pool.
 + Wrong priorities
  + Units and probes first
  + Spotting pylons are cute but should scout starport first

Build
===

 + Scouting and/or dealing with his early scout slightly sets the 
   build off.

Transitions
===

 + When playing v Z transitioning into zealot/colossi is stupid.
   Do either zealot/archon or sentry/colossi.
