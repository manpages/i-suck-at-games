 + Under pressure, especially when we're leading, never forget to put
   drones on gas.  you may lose a game like that.

 + While dealing with terran units that are going along a long line,
   surround might not be the best idea. Make sure that you really outnumber
   them before giving a fight.

 + Against terran, when we see infrantry just go with earlier banelings,
   this will win us a game.  As a rule of thumb, get prepared for their
   attack as you see them amassing, not as you see them leaving their base.

 + Don't trade your lings for their drones in super early game. If the
   game will end in a minute, those drones would have been useless either
   way.

 + In ZvZ, you have to figure out how to even play this matchup.
   Currently I have no fucking clue what to do. Don't even know how to
   think about this! Maybe I should watch a lot of plat / diamond ZvZ's
   and try thinking again. Maybe ask for help.

 + In ZvT, sooner Lair, better preparation for drops, on Lair we can get
   Infestors to catch those with fungal / corrosive bile combo.

 + In ZvZ, if we're going for mutalisks, we have to have enough
   speedlings to kill off roaches, or at least fight them reasonably
   under sunken colonies.
