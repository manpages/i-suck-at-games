 + Under pressure, especially when we're leading, never forget to put drones on gas.
   you may lose a game like that.
 + While dealing with terran units that are going along a long line, surround might
   not be the best idea. Make sure that you really outnumber them before giving a fight.
 + When we see infrantry just go with earlier banelings, this will win us a game.
   As a rule of thumb, get prepared for their attack as you see them amassing, not as you 
   see them leaving their base.
 + Don't trade your lings on their drones in super early game. If the game will end in a
   minute, those drones would have been useless either way.
